Smaller pt size\n\nPoint size can be even smaller in professionally typeset materials like publications and stationery. Text on business cards is often only 6–8 points. At these sizes, all caps text and lowercase are equally legible.\n\npoint size as emphasis\nIt’s fine to emphasize text with a larger point size (or de-emphasize it with a smaller point size). But use the subtlety that point-size adjustments offer. If your body text is set at 11 point, no need to jump to 14 point for emphasis. Start with a smaller increase—say, half a point—and move up in half-point increments until you get the emphasis you need. It’ll be less than you think.\n\npoint size on the web\nYou don’t have to use pixels as the sizing unit in your CSS (and indeed, most prefer not to). But the pixel is the least ambiguous CSS unit. Also, all CSS measurements are eventually converted to pixels in the browser.\n\nFor websites, I recommend body text of 15–25 pixels. As with print, you’ll need to fine-tune based on the particular font you’re using.\n\nWhy? Two reasons. First, we typically read screens from further away than we read printed material, so larger point sizes help compensate. Second, screen fonts are rendered with a relatively small number of pixels, so each extra row of pixels improves the quality. (See also screen-reading considerations.)\n\nYes, I know the web has a long tradition of teeny fonts. It’s time to let it go. This habit arose because the 14-inch monitors common in the 1990s had relatively coarse resolution. It persisted because web designers considered it virtuous to keep accommodating people who refused to upgrade those 14-inch monitors. But now, it’s merely silly.\n\nAlso silly is the web’s tradition of enormous point sizes for headings. This habit started with the default formatting of \u003Ch1> tags in browsers, which is about 200% of the default point size of body text. There is no typographic universe in which you need to double the point size to achieve emphasis. See headings for subtler techniques.\n\nFor more about the entrenched typographic habits of the web, see websites.\n\nBY THE WAY\nIn hyphens and dashes, I mentioned that em refers to a typographer’s measurement, not the letter M. The em size of a font is the same as its point size. Fonts are no longer made of metal, but the em concept persists. Digital fonts are drawn inside a rectangle called the em. To render a font on screen, your computer scales the em to match the current point size. Two fonts set at the same point size will appear to be different sizes if one occupies less space on its em.\n\nCan you determine the point size of a font by measuring it? No. Because of the differences in apparent sizing between fonts, there’s nothing you can measure that would be conclusive. The only way to figure it out is to set the same text, in the same font, with the same line length. Then adjust the point size so it matches the reference sample.\n\nAs you reduce point size, also reduce line spacing and line length. For instance, newspaper fonts are quite small, but remain legible because they have snug line spacing and short line length.\n\nOrganizations that need to control the length of documents (e.g., courts, colleges) usually do so with limits on point size and page length. In the typewriter age, this worked because typewriter output was standardized. In the digital age, it makes less sense, since artful formatting and layout can make documents appear longer or shorter as necessary. Anyone who needs to set standards for document length would be better off putting these rules in terms of word count. Unlike typewriters, all word processors have a word-count function. Compared to page limits, word counts are harder to evade. To be fair, they’re also harder to verify.\n\nIn 2012, a dispute about point size reached the Michigan Supreme Court. One side argued—contrary to 400 years of typographic custom—that a law calling for “14-point type” on a ballot meant that the uppercase letters of the font had to be at least 14 points tall. Fortunately the court did not adopt this interpretation. As a matter of law, it would’ve redefined the meaning of point size within Michigan.\n\n\n","title":"point size","modified":"20240319155825074","modifier":"theophile.dev","ex1":"body{\nmargin:20px;\ndisplay:grid;\ngrid-template-columns:1fr 6ch;\ngap:1ch;\n}\n[font]{\ngrid-column: 1/-1;\ndisplay:grid;\ngrid-template-columns:subgrid;\nfont-size:12pt;\n&:after{\nfont-family:system-ui;\ncontent:attr(font) \"\\A 12pt\";\nwhite-space: pre;\nalign-self:center;\ntext-transform: uppercase;\nfont-size:.6rem;\ngrid-column: 2;\n}\n}\n[font=\"cursive\"]{font-family:cursive;}\n[font=\"monospace\"]{font-family:monospace;}\n[font=\"sans-serif\"]{font-family:sans-serif;}\n","ex2":"body{\nmargin:20px;\ndisplay:grid;\ngrid-template-columns:1fr 6ch;\ngap:1ch;\n}\n[font]{\ngrid-column: 1/-1;\ndisplay:grid;\ngrid-template-columns:subgrid;\nfont-size:12pt;\n&:after{\nfont-family:system-ui;\ncontent:attr(font) \"\\A 12pt\";\nwhite-space: pre;\nalign-self:center;\ntext-transform: uppercase;\nfont-size:.6rem;\ngrid-column: 2;\n}\n}\n[font=\"cursive\"]{\nfont-family:cursive;\nfont-size:11.5pt;\n&:after{content:attr(font) \"\\A 11.5pt\";}\n}\n[font=\"monospace\"]{\nfont-family:monospace;\nfont-size:10pt;\n&:after{content:attr(font) \"\\A 10pt\";}\n}\n[font=\"sans-serif\"]{\nfont-family:sans-serif;\nfont-size:12pt;\n&:after{content:attr(font) \"\\A 12pt\";}\n}\n","source":"https://practicaltypography.com/point-size.html"},

{"created":"20240315214440159","creator":"theophile.dev","text":"source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20818206/10234474\n\nIn word processors and page layout programs, [[line-height|http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/PR-CSS2-20110412/visudet.html#propdef-line-height]] is the space between the baselines of text, but in CSS, it includes space around the text (box model).\n\nCSS uses a formula (`line-height = L + AD`) to calculate this space, where [[AD is the font's height|http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/PR-CSS2-20110412/visudet.html#leading]] and L is extra space added (\"[[half the leading is added above A and the other half below D|https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/PR-CSS2-20110412/visudet.html#leading:~:text=Half%20the%20leading%20is%20added%20above%20A%20and%20the%20other%20half%20below%20D]].\"). This means for text with a certain font size and line-height, there will be equal space above and below (leading) the text:\n\n* `font-size:16px;line-height:24px;` : (24-16)/2 = 4px of leading \n* `font-size:8px;line-height:24px;` : (24-8)/2 = 8px of leading\n\nWhen using % or em units for line-height, children inherit the calculated value, not the unit. This can lead to more space above and below text in smaller elements, adjusting their baseline higher: The children get the same `line-height` as the parent block. But because of the `L + AD` formula, the text of that span has more leading on the top and bottom, and thus the baseline sits higher in its box.  To [[keep baselines aligned|http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/PR-CSS2-20110412/visudet.html#line-height]], the browser pushes down the `smaller` span vertically to match the baselines.\n\nSince the `line-height` property defines [[the minimum height of line boxes within an element|http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/PR-CSS2-20110412/visudet.html#propdef-line-height]], the browser will increase the spacing between lines in the enclosing block to ensures there’s enough room for the baseline of the smaller text to align with the baseline of the larger text without overlapping or crowding.\n\nThe default value of `line-height` is `normal`, a unitless value recommended to be \"[[between 1.0 and 1.2|http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/PR-CSS2-20110412/visudet.html#propdef-line-height]]\". This means that the default spacing between lines will be roughly 100% to 120% of the font size used. When setting line-height using a multiplier (like 1.5), child elements don't inherit this exact value but calculate their own based on their font size:\n\n* `line-height: 1.5; font-size: 14px;` : line height is 14px * 1.5 = 21px\n* If the font size of the child is set to 50%:\n** font size is 14px * 50% = 7px\n** line height is 7px * 1.5 = 10.5px (generally rounded to a whole pixel). Overall, the box of the child is half the size of the surrounding text.\n\nThis calculation ensures that smaller text aligns correctly with the baseline of adjacent text without affecting the spacing of the entire text block.\n\n\u003C$transclude $variable=\"snippet\" field=\"ex1\" html=```\u003Cp>${[{lorem10}]}$\u003Cbr>\u003Cspan>${[{lorem10}]}$\u003C/span>\u003Cbr>${[{lorem10}]}$\u003C/p>``` min-height=\"400px\"/>\n","title":"Using unitless value for line-height","modified":"20240316004721606","modifier":"theophile.dev","ex1":"/*WIP*/\n\np{\ncolor:green;\nfont-size:var(--font-size);\nline-height:24px;\nposition:relative;\n\nspan{\ndisplay:inline-block;\nposition:relative;\ncolor:red;\n\n}\n}\n\n:where(p, p *):before{\nz-index:-1;\nposition:absolute;\ntop:0;\nbottom:0;\ncontent:\"\";\ndisplay:block;\nheight:1lh;\nwidth:100%;\noutline:solid 1px currentColor;\nopacity:.1;\n}"},
